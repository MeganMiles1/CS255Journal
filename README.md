Summary of the DriverPass project: The DriverPass project aimed to design a comprehensive system for driver training, including online classes, practice tests, on-the-road training reservations, and administrative functionalities.

Client: The client was DriverPass, represented by Liam (the owner) and Ian (the IT officer).

Type of system: They wanted a system to handle online classes, practice tests, on-the-road training reservations, and administrative tasks with access from various devices.

What was done well: The detailed and thorough collection of client requirements was done particularly well.

Part to revise: I would revise the class diagram to ensure all relationships and attributes are perfectly aligned with the client's needs.

Interpreting userâ€™s needs: By conducting thorough interviews and clarifying requirements, I implemented features like role-based access, tracking activities, and flexible package management. Considering user needs ensures the system is user-friendly and meets client expectations.

Approach to designing software: I use an iterative approach, starting with requirement gathering, followed by use case and activity diagrams, and refining through feedback. Future strategies include adopting agile methodologies and more frequent user feedback sessions to refine system design continuously.
